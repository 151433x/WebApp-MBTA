## Project Overview

The goal of this project is put into practice the learnings we did in class, which includes working with Web API's, working with JSON files, and utilizing Flask to build a simple web app. For API's, we work with two separate sites: MapQuest and the MBTA.
We then pull out data as JSON files from these sites to work with the coordinate data and a mapping system. MapQuest allows us to pull longitude and latitude data from a location's name or address. However, we find that using the specific address provides the most accurate stops' information while using a name provides very inconsistent results. The MBTA API then allows us to locate the nearest station from the coordinate data and also provides the data on the accessibility of the station. Putting all these together, we then use all of thein formation to build a simple wep app that allows the user to determine the nearest MBTA stop and whether it is wheelchair accessible by entering a valid address. The app is compiled into a viewable HMTL by Flask. Our final web app will also display a map showing the pinpoint location of the actual stop in order to a give visual aid for the user to find the stop in one place. 

## Project Reflection

The building progress for this project went quite smoothly despite one of our team member (Navin) testing positive for COVID and was in quarantine this past week. We decided to split the work by having the person able to attend classes perform most of the code while the other person attempts to follow along. This worked well as the person coding were able to walk the other person through the code, and through that, we were able to debug some of the issues we ran into as well as smooth out some of the inefficiencies in the code. Collaborating on GitHub also proved to be very helpful as each team member was always up to date with the latest code, which helps a lot with the communication process. 

As for actual code itself, we feel that we have accomplished most of the things we had set out to do in the first place. However, we felt that we definitely could have pushed our scope further if we had the time and none of the set backs. First, we would have loved to be able to expand our API to that of commuter rails and buses as well so that we can provide users with a more complete coverage of the transportation options. Second, we also would have loved to expand to a couple more citys such as New York or Washington D.C to get familiair with more APIs' documentation and help users in different areas than us. It would also add a level of complexity to our code that would definitely teach us a lot more in building a more complete program than what we have been used to in class. Lastly, if given the chance, we could also build more complex features into web app such as improving our UI, linking the MBTA maps, or letting users interact with the map to more easily navigate their way to a stop. 

With all these things in mind, we think that we have done a lot despite the tough situation we were put into. We have definitely learned about working with different APIs and data. Similar to the previous assignment, we realized that this class has really taught us a lot about the utility of Python and we are now in a more capable spot than we thought of ourselves prior to these assignments.
